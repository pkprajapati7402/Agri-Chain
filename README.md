## 🌟 Vision  

> *"Every farmer who feeds the world deserves instant access to fair finance. Kisan Kosh makes this possible through blockchain innovation."*  

Kisan Kosh bridges the gap between **stored agricultural value** and **accessible finance**. By converting warehouse receipts (e-NWRs) into NFTs on the Aptos blockchain, farmers can unlock liquidity without distress selling — empowering them to wait for fair prices while staying financially secure.  

---

## 🚨 The Problem  

### 📊 Agricultural Crisis  
- **146,000+ suicides** in the last decade due to financial distress  
- **70%** of farmers forced to sell crops immediately at 40–60% below market rates  
- **₹50,000 crores lost** annually to distress selling  
- Only **14%** access institutional credit  

### 💔 The Cycle of Poverty  
1. Farmers harvest → need instant cash  
2. Forced to sell at low post-harvest prices  
3. Prices rise 40–60% months later  
4. Farmers remain trapped in debt and poverty
